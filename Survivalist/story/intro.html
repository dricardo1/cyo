//Joel is a single father living in Texas with his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah. One night, a sudden outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, which changes its human hosts into cannibalistic monsters. As Joel, his brother Tommy, and Sarah flee the initial chaos, Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel's arms.

In the 20 years that follow, much of civilization is destroyed by the infection. Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones, independent settlements, and nomadic groups. Joel works as a smuggler with his friend Tess in a quarantine zone in Boston. The pair hunt down a local gangster to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him, the smuggler reveals that he traded the goods to the Fireflies, a rebel group fighting against the quarantine zone authorities. The leader of the Fireflies, Marlene, promises to double their stolen cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie, to Fireflies hiding outside the quarantine.

Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago, and that her immunity may lead to a cure. The trio fight their way out of the quarantine zone to the drop-off point, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. //

Darkness surrounds you in every direction. Is it for a few feet? For a thousand miles? You neither know, nor care. 

Distantly, you hear the distant drip-drip-drip of water into some long forgotten pit. Your hair feels filthy and matted under your head.

*How long has it been…? I don’t know. No way to tell.*

You stare up into an inky blackness for a long time.

*If only there was some way to get out of here…*
