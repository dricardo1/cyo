Then, distantly at first, little glowing specks of light begin to appear. As you walk towards them, they become brighter and brighter.

*"You had to hit him?"* a voice asks impatiently.

A pause. "It will do."

"What do you think?" A third voice, a woman's.

"He *does* look a lot like Davison, doesn't he."

"Yes, he does," she said. *She sounds... proud?*
