“You’re… Lisa?” 

The woman looks shocked. “How did you know my name? I…” 

She takes you by the arm. Her grip is gentle, her skin soft. “I’m so sorry about what’s happened to you. Here, I need to give you this.” She hands you a small folder. “Keep it hid. Once you get out, open it.”

She kisses you.

“Hurry, we have to go.”
